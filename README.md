# 🌸 Afifa's First Portfolio Website(2022)

A simple, cute, and handcrafted HTML portfolio — built in 2022 when I first started exploring web development ✨

This was my very first attempt at creating a personal site with just HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of dreams.

## 🙋‍♀️ Why I Made This

This was my baby step into the world of tech.  
I just wanted to build *something of my own* and put it on the internet. This portfolio may be simple, but it marks the beginning of my journey into design, frontend, and confidence 🫶

## 📌 Notes

- No JavaScript was harmed during the making of this site
- Hosted on Netlify (my go-to in those days!)
- Might look quirky on mobile, but that’s okay — I was learning!

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- 💻 A lot of googling + excitement

## ❤️ Thank You

If you're someone who's just starting like I was back then — keep going!  
It’s not about being perfect, it’s about being proud 💗
